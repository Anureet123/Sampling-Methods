# Sampling Methods
This assignment includes trying diferent sampling techniques on a dataset and then applying 5 different models and finding the best model.
5 sampling techniques used for this imbalanced data are- 
1. Random Oversampling
2. K fold
3. Random Sampling
4. Systematic Sampling
5. Cluster Sampling

5 Machine learning models used:
1. Decision Tree Classifier	
2. Logistic Regression
3. KNN Classifier
4. SVM Classifier
5. Passive Aggressive Classifier

The best model wrt each sampling technique:
1. Random Oversampling - Decision Tree Classifier	
2. K fold - SVM Classifier
3. Random Sampling - KNN Classifier
4. Systematic Sampling - Logistic Regression
5. Cluster Sampling - Passive Aggressive Classifier
